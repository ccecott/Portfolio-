            I am a Frontend Web Developer eager to
            bring my newly honed technical skills to a company
            looking for a Junior Developer with grit. The future is built with
            technology, and I want to build it. I am always looking to push
            myself, and I'm very interested in studying new languages
            and programs. </p>
